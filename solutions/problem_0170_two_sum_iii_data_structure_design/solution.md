## Description

*(Premium problem -- description requires LeetCode subscription)*

## Approach: Two Pointers

Use two pointers moving through the data structure. Depending on the problem, pointers may move toward each other (converging), in the same direction (fast/slow), or independently.

## Pseudocode

```
1. Initialize left = 0, right = n-1 (or two independent pointers)
2. While pointers haven't crossed:
   a. Evaluate condition at pointer positions
   b. Move left pointer right or right pointer left
3. Return result
```

## Algorithm Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[left = 0, right = n-1] --> B{left < right?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Evaluate at left, right]
    C --> D{Condition met?}
    D -- Yes --> E[Record result]
    D -- No --> F{Adjust which pointer?}
    F --> G[Move left right]
    F --> H[Move right left]
    G --> B
    H --> B
    E --> I[Return answer]
    B -- No --> I
```

## Visual State Transitions

**Two Pointer Convergence:**

**Frame 1: Initialize pointers**
```mermaid
graph LR
    L["L=0"] --- A0["1"] --- A1["3"] --- A2["5"] --- A3["7"] --- A4["9"] --- R["R=4"]
    S["Target sum = 10"]
```

**Frame 2: Sum = 1+9 = 10, found!**
```mermaid
graph LR
    L["L=0 -> 1"] --- A1["3"] --- A2["5"] --- A3["7"] --- R["R=4 -> 9"]
    S["1 + 9 = 10 = Target. FOUND!"]
```
