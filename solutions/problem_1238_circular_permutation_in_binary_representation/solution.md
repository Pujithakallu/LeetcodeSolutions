# Problem 1238: Circular Permutation in Binary Representation

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags:** Math, Backtracking, Bit Manipulation  
**Pattern:** Backtracking  
**Link:** [leetcode.com/problems/circular-permutation-in-binary-representation](https://leetcode.com/problems/circular-permutation-in-binary-representation/)

## Description

Given 2 integers `n` and `start`. Your task is return **any** permutation `p` of `(0,1,2.....,2^n -1) `such that :



	- `p[0] = start`
	- `p[i]` and `p[i+1]` differ by only one bit in their binary representation.
	- `p[0]` and `p[2^n -1]` must also differ by only one bit in their binary representation.


 

Example 1:



```

**Input:** n = 2, start = 3
**Output:** [3,2,0,1]
**Explanation:** The binary representation of the permutation is (11,10,00,01). 
All the adjacent element differ by one bit. Another valid permutation is [3,1,0,2]

```


Example 2:



```

**Input:** n = 3, start = 2
**Output:** [2,6,7,5,4,0,1,3]
**Explanation:** The binary representation of the permutation is (010,110,111,101,100,000,001,011).

```


 

**Constraints:**



	- `1 <= n <= 16`
	- `0 <= start < 2 ^ n`

## Approach: Backtracking

Explore all possible solutions by building candidates incrementally. At each step, make a choice and recurse. If the choice leads to a dead end, undo the choice (backtrack) and try the next option.

## Pseudocode

```
1. Define backtrack(path, choices):
   a. If path is a complete solution: add to results
   b. For each choice in choices:
      - If choice is valid:
        * Add choice to path
        * backtrack(path, remaining_choices)
        * Remove choice from path (backtrack)
2. Call backtrack([], all_choices)
```

## Algorithm Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["backtrack(path, choices)"] --> B{Path complete?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Add path to results]
    B -- No --> D[For each valid choice]
    D --> E[Add choice to path]
    E --> F["backtrack(path, remaining)"]
    F --> G[Remove choice from path]
    G --> D
    D --> H{All choices tried}
    H --> I[Return]
```

## Visual State Transitions

**Backtracking Decision Tree:**

**Frame 1: Root - start with empty path**
```mermaid
graph TD
    R["[] choices: 1,2,3"]
    R --- A["[1]"]
    R --- B["[2]"]
    R --- C["[3]"]
```

**Frame 2: Explore branch [1]**
```mermaid
graph TD
    R["[]"]
    R --- A["[1]"]
    A --- A1["[1,2]"]
    A --- A2["[1,3]"]
    A1 --- A1a["[1,2,3] SOLUTION"]
    R --- B["[2] ..."]
    R --- C["[3] ..."]
```

**Frame 3: Backtrack, explore [2]**
```mermaid
graph TD
    R["[]"]
    R --- A["[1] done"]
    R --- B["[2]"]
    B --- B1["[2,1]"]
    B --- B2["[2,3]"]
    B1 --- B1a["[2,1,3] SOLUTION"]
    R --- C["[3] ..."]
```

**Frame 4: All solutions found**
```mermaid
graph TD
    R["Complete: 6 permutations found"]
    R --- S1["[1,2,3]"]
    R --- S2["[1,3,2]"]
    R --- S3["[2,1,3] ..."]
```


## Complexity Analysis

- **Time:** O(k^n) or O(n!)
- **Space:** O(n)

## Solution (Python3)

```python
class Solution:
    def circularPermutation(self, n: int, start: int) -> List[int]:
        # Backtracking - O(2^n) or O(n!) time
        result = []
        
        def backtrack(path, start):
            result.append(path[:])
            for i in range(start, len(n)):
                path.append(n[i])
                backtrack(path, i + 1)
                path.pop()
        
        backtrack([], 0)
        return result
```

## Solution (C++)

```cpp
#include <functional>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> circularPermutation(int n, int start) {
        // Backtracking - O(2^n) or O(n!) time
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        vector<int> path;
        function<void(int)> backtrack = [&](int start) {
            result.push_back(path);
            for (int i = start; i < (int)n.size(); i++) {
                path.push_back(n[i]);
                backtrack(i + 1);
                path.pop_back();
            }
        };
        backtrack(0);
        return result;
    }
};
```
