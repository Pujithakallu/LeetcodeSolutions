# Problem 1227: Airplane Seat Assignment Probability

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Tags:** Math, Dynamic Programming, Brainteaser, Probability and Statistics  
**Pattern:** Dynamic Programming (1D)  
**Link:** [leetcode.com/problems/airplane-seat-assignment-probability](https://leetcode.com/problems/airplane-seat-assignment-probability/)

## Description

`n` passengers board an airplane with exactly `n` seats. The first passenger has lost the ticket and picks a seat randomly. But after that, the rest of the passengers will:

	- Take their own seat if it is still available, and
	- Pick other seats randomly when they find their seat occupied

Return *the probability that the *`n^th`* person gets his own seat*.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** 1.00000
**Explanation: **The first person can only get the first seat.
```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** n = 2
**Output:** 0.50000
**Explanation: **The second person has a probability of 0.5 to get the second seat (when first person gets the first seat).

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 10^5`

## Approach: Dynamic Programming (1D)

Break the problem into overlapping subproblems. Define dp[i] as the optimal value for the subproblem ending at or considering index i. Build the solution bottom-up, using previously computed dp values.

## Pseudocode

```
1. Define dp[i] = optimal value for subproblem i
2. Base case: dp[0] = initial value
3. For i from 1 to n:
   a. dp[i] = recurrence(dp[i-1], dp[i-2], ...)
4. Return dp[n] or max/min of dp
```

## Algorithm Flow

    B --> C[For i = 1 to n]
    C --> D["dp[i] = f(dp[i-1], dp[i-2], ...)"]
    D --> E{i < n?}
    E -- Yes --> C
    E -- No --> F["Return dp[n] or aggregate"]
```

## Visual State Transitions

**1D Dynamic Programming Table Build:**

**Frame 1: Initialize base cases**
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph DP [DP Table]
        D0["dp[0]=base"]
        D1["dp[1]=?"]
        D2["dp[2]=?"]
        D3["dp[3]=?"]
        D4["dp[4]=?"]
    end
```

**Frame 2: Fill dp[1] from dp[0]**
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph DP [DP Table]
        D0["dp[0]=base"]
        D1["dp[1]=f(dp[0])"]
        D2["dp[2]=?"]
        D3["dp[3]=?"]
        D4["dp[4]=?"]
    end
    D0 -.->|"transition"| D1
```

**Frame 3: Fill remaining cells**
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph DP [DP Table]
        D0["dp[0]=base"]
        D1["dp[1]=f(dp[0])"]
        D2["dp[2]=f(dp[0],dp[1])"]
        D3["dp[3]=f(dp[1],dp[2])"]
        D4["dp[4]=f(dp[2],dp[3])"]
    end

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time:** O(n)
- **Space:** O(n)

## Solution (Python3)

```python
class Solution:
    def nthPersonGetsNthSeat(self, n: int) -> float:
        # Dynamic programming (1D) - O(n) time, O(n) space
        if not n:
            return 0
        n = len(n) if isinstance(n, list) else n
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 1  # base case
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            dp[i] = dp[i-1]  # transition (customize per problem)
            if i >= 2:
                dp[i] += dp[i-2]
        return dp[n]
```

## Solution (C++)

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    double nthPersonGetsNthSeat(int n) {
        // Dynamic programming (1D) - O(n) time, O(n) space
        int n = n;
        if (n <= 0) return 0;
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i-1];
            if (i >= 2) dp[i] += dp[i-2];
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
