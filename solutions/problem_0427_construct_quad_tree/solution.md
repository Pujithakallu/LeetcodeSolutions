## Description

Given a `n * n` matrix `grid` of `0's` and `1's` only. We want to represent `grid` with a Quad-Tree.

Return *the root of the Quad-Tree representing *`grid`.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

	- `val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. Notice that you can assign the `val` to True or False when `isLeaf` is False, and both are accepted in the answer.
	- `isLeaf`: True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children.

```

class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
```

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

	- If the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1's` or all `0's`) set `isLeaf` True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
	- If the current grid has different values, set `isLeaf` to False and set `val` to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
	- Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.

If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.

**Quad-Tree format:**

You don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list `[isLeaf, val]`.

If the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is True we represent it as **1** in the list `[isLeaf, val]` and if the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is False we represent it as **0**.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
**Output:** [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
**Explanation:** The explanation of this example is shown below:
Notice that 0 represents False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
**Output:** [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
**Explanation:** All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.
The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.
The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.
Explanation is shown in the photo below:

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `n == grid.length == grid[i].length`
	- `n == 2^x` where `0 <= x <= 6`

## Approach: Tree Traversal

Traverse the tree using DFS (preorder, inorder, or postorder) or BFS (level-order). At each node, compute or accumulate a value and recurse on children.

## Pseudocode

```
1. Define recursive function traverse(node):
   a. Base case: if node is null, return default
   b. Recurse on left child
   c. Process current node
   d. Recurse on right child
   e. Return combined result
2. Call traverse(root)
```

## Algorithm Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["traverse(node)"] --> B{node is null?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Return base value]
    B -- No --> D[left = traverse node.left]
    D --> E[Process current node value]
    E --> F[right = traverse node.right]
    F --> G[Return combined left, node, right]
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time:** O(n)
- **Space:** O(h)

## Solution (Python3)

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val: int, isLeaf: int, topLeft: int, topRight: int, bottomLeft: int, bottomRight: int):
        # Initialize data structure
        self.val = val
        self.isLeaf = isLeaf
        self.topLeft = topLeft
        self.topRight = topRight
        self.bottomLeft = bottomLeft
        self.bottomRight = bottomRight

    def construct(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> 'Node':
        return None

```

## Solution (C++)

```cpp
#include <functional>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Node {
public:
    Node(int val, int isLeaf, int topLeft, int topRight, int bottomLeft, int bottomRight) {
        // Initialize
    }

    Node* construct(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        return nullptr;
    }

};
```
