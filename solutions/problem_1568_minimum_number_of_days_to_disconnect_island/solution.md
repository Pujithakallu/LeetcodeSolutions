# Problem 1568: Minimum Number of Days to Disconnect Island

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Tags:** Array, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Matrix, Strongly Connected Component  
**Pattern:** DFS on Matrix / Grid  
**Link:** [leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-days-to-disconnect-island](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-days-to-disconnect-island/)

## Description

You are given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where `1` represents land and `0` represents water. An **island** is a maximal **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical) connected group of `1`'s.

The grid is said to be **connected** if we have **exactly one island**, otherwise is said **disconnected**.

In one day, we are allowed to change **any **single land cell `(1)` into a water cell `(0)`.

Return *the minimum number of days to disconnect the grid*.

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]

**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We need at least 2 days to get a disconnected grid.
Change land grid[1][1] and grid[0][2] to water and get 2 disconnected island.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** grid = [[1,1]]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Grid of full water is also disconnected ([[1,1]] -> [[0,0]]), 0 islands.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `m == grid.length`
	- `n == grid[i].length`
	- `1 <= m, n <= 30`
	- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Approach: DFS on Matrix / Grid

Treat the grid as a graph where each cell connects to its 4 (or 8) neighbors. DFS from target cells, marking visited to avoid revisiting.

## Pseudocode

```
1. For each cell (r, c) in grid:
   a. If cell meets start condition:
      - Call dfs(r, c)
2. dfs(r, c):
   a. If out of bounds or visited or invalid: return
   b. Mark cell visited
   c. Recurse on 4 neighbors: up, down, left, right
3. Return result
```

## Algorithm Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[For each cell in grid] --> B{Matches start condition?}
    B -- Yes --> C["dfs(r, c)"]
    B -- No --> A
    C --> D{Out of bounds or visited?}
    D -- Yes --> E[Return]
    D -- No --> F[Mark visited, process cell]
    F --> G["dfs(r+1,c), dfs(r-1,c)"]
    G --> H["dfs(r,c+1), dfs(r,c-1)"]
    H --> I[Return result]
```

## Visual State Transitions

**DFS on Grid (Island/Flood Fill):**

**Frame 1: Find first land cell**
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Grid
        R0["1  1  0"]
        R1["1  0  0"]
        R2["0  0  1"]
    end
    S["Start DFS at (0,0)"]
```

**Frame 2: DFS explores connected cells**
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Grid
        R0["V  1  0"]
        R1["1  0  0"]
        R2["0  0  1"]
    end
    S["Visited (0,0), explore neighbors"]
```

**Frame 3: Mark entire island**
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Grid
        R0["V  V  0"]
        R1["V  0  0"]
        R2["0  0  1"]
    end
    S["Island 1 complete, area=3"]
```

**Frame 4: Find second island**
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Grid
        R0["V  V  0"]
        R1["V  0  0"]
        R2["0  0  V"]
    end
    S["Island 2 at (2,2), area=1. Total=2 islands"]
```


## Complexity Analysis

- **Space:** O(m * n)

## Solution (Python3)

```python
class Solution:
    def minDays(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # DFS on grid - O(m*n) time
        if not grid:
            return 0
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        count = 0
        
        def dfs(r, c):
            if r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols:
                return
            if grid[r][c] == '0' or grid[r][c] == 0:
                return
            grid[r][c] = '0'
            dfs(r+1, c); dfs(r-1, c)
            dfs(r, c+1); dfs(r, c-1)
        
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == '1' or grid[r][c] == 1:
                    dfs(r, c)
                    count += 1
        return count
```

## Solution (C++)

```cpp
#include <functional>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minDays(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        // DFS on grid - O(m*n) time
        if (grid.empty()) return 0;
        int rows = grid.size(), cols = grid[0].size();
        int count = 0;
        function<void(int, int)> dfs = [&](int r, int c) {
            if (r < 0 || r >= rows || c < 0 || c >= cols) return;
            if (grid[r][c] == '0') return;
            grid[r][c] = '0';
            dfs(r+1, c); dfs(r-1, c);
            dfs(r, c+1); dfs(r, c-1);
        };
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] == '1') {
                    dfs(r, c);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
