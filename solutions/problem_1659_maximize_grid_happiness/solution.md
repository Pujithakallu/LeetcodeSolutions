# Problem 1659: Maximize Grid Happiness

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Tags:** Dynamic Programming, Bit Manipulation, Memoization, Bitmask  
**Pattern:** Dynamic Programming (Bitmask)  
**Link:** [leetcode.com/problems/maximize-grid-happiness](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-grid-happiness/)

## Description

You are given four integers, `m`, `n`, `introvertsCount`, and `extrovertsCount`. You have an `m x n` grid, and there are two types of people: introverts and extroverts. There are `introvertsCount` introverts and `extrovertsCount` extroverts.

You should decide how many people you want to live in the grid and assign each of them one grid cell. Note that you **do not** have to have all the people living in the grid.

The **happiness** of each person is calculated as follows:

	- Introverts **start** with `120` happiness and **lose** `30` happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).
	- Extroverts **start** with `40` happiness and **gain** `20` happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).

Neighbors live in the directly adjacent cells north, east, south, and west of a person's cell.

The **grid happiness** is the **sum** of each person's happiness. Return* the **maximum possible grid happiness**.*

 

Example 1:

```

**Input:** m = 2, n = 3, introvertsCount = 1, extrovertsCount = 2
**Output:** 240
**Explanation:** Assume the grid is 1-indexed with coordinates (row, column).
We can put the introvert in cell (1,1) and put the extroverts in cells (1,3) and (2,3).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (0 * 30) (0 neighbors) = 120
- Extrovert at (1,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
- Extrovert at (2,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
The grid happiness is 120 + 60 + 60 = 240.
The above figure shows the grid in this example with each person's happiness. The introvert stays in the light green cell while the extroverts live on the light purple cells.

```

Example 2:

```

**Input:** m = 3, n = 1, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1
**Output:** 260
**Explanation:** Place the two introverts in (1,1) and (3,1) and the extrovert at (2,1).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 * 20) (2 neighbors) = 80
- Introvert at (3,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
The grid happiness is 90 + 80 + 90 = 260.

```

Example 3:

```

**Input:** m = 2, n = 2, introvertsCount = 4, extrovertsCount = 0
**Output:** 240

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= m, n <= 5`
	- `0 <= introvertsCount, extrovertsCount <= min(m * n, 6)`

## Approach: Dynamic Programming (Bitmask)

Use bitmask to represent subsets of n elements. dp[mask] = optimal value when the selected subset is represented by mask. Iterate over all masks and transitions.

## Pseudocode

```
1. dp[0] = base case
2. For mask from 0 to 2^n - 1:
   a. For each bit i not set in mask:
      - new_mask = mask | (1 << i)
      - dp[new_mask] = best of dp[new_mask], dp[mask] + cost(i)
3. Return dp[(1 << n) - 1]
```

## Algorithm Flow

```mermaid

    A["dp[0] = base case"] --> B[For each bitmask state]
    B --> C[For each unset bit i]
    C --> D["new_mask = mask | 1 left-shift i"]
    D --> E["dp[new_mask] = best(dp[new_mask], dp[mask] + cost)"]
    E --> C
    C --> F{All masks processed?}
    F -- No --> B
    F -- Yes --> G["Return dp[all bits set]"]
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time:** O(2^n * n)
- **Space:** O(2^n)

## Solution (Python3)

```python
class Solution:
    def getMaxGridHappiness(self, m: int, n: int, introvertsCount: int, extrovertsCount: int) -> int:
        # Bitmask DP - O(2^n * n) time
        n = len(m)
        dp = [float('inf')] * (1 << n)
        dp[0] = 0
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            bits = bin(mask).count('1')
            for i in range(n):
                if mask & (1 << i):
                    continue
                new_mask = mask | (1 << i)
                dp[new_mask] = min(dp[new_mask], dp[mask] + 1)
        return dp[(1 << n) - 1]
```

## Solution (C++)

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int getMaxGridHappiness(int m, int n, int introvertsCount, int extrovertsCount) {
        // Bitmask DP - O(2^n * n) time
        int n = m.size();
        vector<int> dp(1 << n, INT_MAX);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (mask & (1 << i)) continue;
                int new_mask = mask | (1 << i);
                dp[new_mask] = min(dp[new_mask], dp[mask] + 1);
            }
        }
        return dp[(1 << n) - 1];
    }
};
```
