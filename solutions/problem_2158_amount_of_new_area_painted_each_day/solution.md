## Description

*(Premium problem -- description requires LeetCode subscription)*

## Approach: Segment Tree

Build a segment tree for range queries (sum, min, max) with point or range updates. Each node covers a range; queries are answered by combining relevant segments.

## Pseudocode

```
1. Build segment tree from array (O(n))
2. Query(l, r):
   - If node range within [l,r]: return node value
   - If no overlap: return identity
   - Else: combine query(left_child) and query(right_child)
3. Update(i, val): update leaf and propagate up
```

## Algorithm Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Build segment tree from array] --> B{"Query or Update?"}
    B -- "Query(l,r)" --> C{Node range in query range?}
    C -- Fully inside --> D[Return node value]
    C -- No overlap --> E[Return identity]
    C -- Partial --> F[Query both children, combine]
    B -- "Update(i,v)" --> G[Update leaf node]
    G --> H[Propagate changes up to root]
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time:** O(n log n) build, O(log n) query/update
- **Space:** O(n)

## Solution (Python3)

```python
class Solution:
    pass
```

## Solution (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Design problem stub
};
```
