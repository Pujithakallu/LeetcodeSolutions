# Problem 248: Strobogrammatic Number III

**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Tags:** Array, String, Recursion  
**Pattern:** String Processing  
**Link:** [leetcode.com/problems/strobogrammatic-number-iii](https://leetcode.com/problems/strobogrammatic-number-iii/)

## Description

*(Premium problem -- description requires LeetCode subscription)*

## Approach: String Processing

Process the string character by character. Common techniques: two pointers, sliding window, hash map for frequencies, stack for matching.

## Pseudocode

```
1. Initialize result / tracking state
2. Iterate through string characters:
   a. Process character based on rules
   b. Update state (counters, pointers, stack)
3. Build and return result
```

## Algorithm Flow

```mermaid

    A[Initialize state] --> B[For each character in string]
    B --> C[Process character]
    C --> D[Update state / counters]
    D --> E{More characters?}
    E -- Yes --> B
    E -- No --> F[Build result from state]
    F --> G[Return result]
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time:** O(n)
- **Space:** O(n)

## Solution (Python3)

```python
class Solution:
    pass
```

## Solution (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Design problem stub
};
```
