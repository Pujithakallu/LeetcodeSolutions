# Problem 392: Is Subsequence

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Tags:** Two Pointers, String, Dynamic Programming

## Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true`* if *`s`* is a **subsequence** of *`t`*, or *`false`* otherwise*.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

 

Example 1:

```
**Input:** s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
**Output:** true

```
Example 2:

```
**Input:** s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
**Output:** false

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `0 <= s.length <= 100`
	- `0 <= t.length <= 10^4`
	- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

 

**Follow up:** Suppose there are lots of incoming `s`, say `s1, s2, ..., sk` where `k >= 10^9`, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

## Approach: Dynamic Programming (String)

Compare or match two strings using a 2D DP table. dp[i][j] represents the answer for substrings s1[0..i-1] and s2[0..j-1]. Common patterns: LCS, edit distance, regex matching.

## Pseudocode

```
1. Create dp[m+1][n+1]
2. Initialize base cases
3. For i from 1 to m:
   For j from 1 to n:
     If s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
     Else: dp[i][j] = best of (dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])
4. Return dp[m][n]
```

## Algorithm Flow

    A["dp[m+1][n+1] = 0"] --> B[For i = 1 to m]
    B --> C[For j = 1 to n]
    C --> D{"s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]?"}
    D -- Yes --> E["dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1"]
    D -- No --> F["dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])"]
    E --> G{More chars?}
    F --> G
    G -- Yes --> C
    G -- No --> H["Return dp[m][n]"]
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time:** O(m * n)
- **Space:** O(m * n)

## Solution (Python3)

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # String DP - O(m*n) time and space
        m, n = len(s), len(t)
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if s[i-1] == t[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
        return dp[m][n]
```

## Solution (C++)

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string& s, string& t) {
        // String DP - O(m*n) time and space
        int m = s.size(), n = t.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (s[i-1] == t[j-1])
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
                else
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```
