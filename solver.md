## Pattern Cheat Sheet

| Pattern | When to Use | Key Data Structure |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Hash Map Lookup** | Need O(1) lookup for complement/target | Dictionary / Set |
| **Two Pointers** | Sorted array, pair finding, partitioning | Two index variables |
| **Sliding Window** | Contiguous subarray/substring optimization | Window bounds + map |
| **Fast and Slow Pointers** | Cycle detection, middle finding | Two-speed pointers |
| **Binary Search** | Sorted data, search space reduction | Low/high bounds |
| **BFS** | Shortest path, level-order traversal | Queue |
| **DFS** | Tree/graph traversal, backtracking | Stack / Recursion |
| **Dynamic Programming** | Overlapping subproblems, optimal substructure | DP table/memo |
| **Greedy** | Local optimal leads to global optimal | Priority Queue / Sort |
| **Backtracking** | Generate all combinations/permutations | Recursion + pruning |
| **Union Find** | Connected components, cycle detection in undirected graph | Parent array |
| **Topological Sort** | Dependency ordering, DAG processing | In-degree + queue |
| **Trie** | Prefix matching, word search | Trie node tree |
| **Monotonic Stack** | Next greater/smaller element | Stack |
| **Interval Merge** | Overlapping intervals | Sort + sweep |
